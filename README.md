# Cardano DeCipher
A program in the Oberon language for decrypting a Cardano cipher by creating a constructor and iterating through all possible 4x4 grids.
The ciphertext input is embedded directly within the program:
```
BEGIN
  Decipher(4, 'DKTĪRUKVLĀU_RAMS')
END Cardane.

```

## Comments
Will be translated into GO language, maybe...
